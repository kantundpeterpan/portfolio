    "text": "Probabilistic Model\nThe model assumes a “switch point” (e.g. a year during which safety regulations changed), and Poisson-distributed disaster rate with constant (but potentially different) rates before and after that switch point.\nThe actual disaster count is fixed (observed); any sample of this model will need to specify both the switchpoint and the “early” and “late” rate of disasters.\nOriginal model from pymc3 documentation example:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(D_t|s,e,l)&\\sim \\text{Poisson}(r_t), \\\\\n  & \\,\\quad\\text{with}\\; r_t = \\begin{cases}e & \\text{if}\\; t &lt; s\\\\l &\\text{if}\\; t \\ge s\\end{cases} \\\\\ns&\\sim\\text{Discrete Uniform}(t_l,\\,t_h) \\\\\ne&\\sim\\text{Exponential}(r_e)\\\\\nl&\\sim\\text{Exponential}(r_l)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nHowever, the mean disaster rate \\(r_t\\) has a discontinuity at the switchpoint \\(s\\), which makes it not differentiable. Thus it provides no gradient signal to the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm – but because the \\(s\\) prior is continuous, HMC’s fallback to a random walk is good enough to find the areas of high probability mass in this example.\nAs a second model, we modify the original model using a sigmoid “switch” between e and l to make the transition differentiable, and use a continuous uniform distribution for the switchpoint \\(s\\). (One could argue this model is more true to reality, as a “switch” in mean rate would likely be stretched out over multiple years.) The new model is thus:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(D_t|s,e,l)&\\sim\\text{Poisson}(r_t), \\\\\n& \\,\\quad \\text{with}\\; r_t = e + \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(s-t)}(l-e) \\\\\ns&\\sim\\text{Uniform}(t_l,\\,t_h) \\\\\ne&\\sim\\text{Exponential}(r_e)\\\\\nl&\\sim\\text{Exponential}(r_l)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIn the absence of more information we assume \\(r_e = r_l = 1\\) as parameters for the priors. We’ll run both models and compare their inference results.\n\ndef disaster_count_model(disaster_rate_fn):\n  disaster_count = tfd.JointDistributionNamed(dict(\n    e=tfd.Exponential(rate=1.),\n    l=tfd.Exponential(rate=1.),\n    s=tfd.Uniform(0., high=len(years)),\n    d_t=lambda s, l, e: tfd.Independent(\n        tfd.Poisson(rate=disaster_rate_fn(np.arange(len(years)), s, l, e)),\n        reinterpreted_batch_ndims=1)\n  ))\n  return disaster_count\n\ndef disaster_rate_switch(ys, s, l, e):\n  return tf.where(ys &lt; s, e, l)\n\ndef disaster_rate_sigmoid(ys, s, l, e):\n  return e + tf.sigmoid(ys - s) * (l - e)\n\nmodel_switch = disaster_count_model(disaster_rate_switch)\nmodel_sigmoid = disaster_count_model(disaster_rate_sigmoid)\n\nThe above code defines the model via JointDistributionSequential distributions. The disaster_rate functions are called with an array of [0, ..., len(years)-1] to produce a vector of len(years) random variables – the years before the switchpoint are early_disaster_rate, the ones after late_disaster_rate (modulo the sigmoid transition).\nHere is a sanity-check that the target log prob function is sane:\n\ndef target_log_prob_fn(model, s, e, l):\n  return model.log_prob(s=s, e=e, l=l, d_t=disaster_data)\n\nmodels = [model_switch, model_sigmoid]\nprint([target_log_prob_fn(m, 40., 3., .9).numpy() for m in models])  # Somewhat likely result\nprint([target_log_prob_fn(m, 60., 1., 5.).numpy() for m in models])  # Rather unlikely result\nprint([target_log_prob_fn(m, -10., 1., 1.).numpy() for m in models]) # Impossible result\n\n[-176.9456, -176.28719]\n[-371.3125, -366.8816]\n[-inf, -inf]",

The Beta distribution’s support is \\(\\left[0, 1\\right]\\) and therefore particularly suited to model an event probability. In fact, it is also the conjugate prior of the Binomial distribution (of which the the Bernoulli distribution is a special case with \\(n=1\\)). That means that normally, no MCMC sampling would be necessary for to obtain the posterior probability once we have seen the new data.\nIn the model definition code below, the Binomial classe with the corresponding parameters to mimic a Bernoulli distribution are used in both tensorflow and pymc, this makes the code easily extendable to other models.\n\nTensorflowPyMC\n\n\n\ndef bernoulli():\n    p = tfd.Beta(concentration1 = 2, concentration0 = 5,\n                      force_probs_to_zero_outside_support = True\n                     )\n    \n    obs = lambda p: tfd.Sample(\n        distribution = tfd.Binomial(\n                            total_count = 1,\n                            probs = p\n                            ),\n        sample_shape = data_size\n    )\n                      \n    return tfd.JointDistributionNamedAutoBatched(\n        dict(p = p, obs = obs)    \n    )\n\n# Create the model\njoint_distribution = bernoulli() if categories == 1 else multi()\n\n# Define the target log probability function\ndef target_log_prob(p):\n    return joint_distribution.log_prob({'p': p, 'obs': observed_data})\n\nprint(target_log_prob(true_p))\n\ntf.Tensor([-11.182529], shape=(1,), dtype=float32)\n\n\n\n\n\n# # Import necessary libraries\n# import pymc as pm\n# import numpy as np\n\n# # Generate some example data\n# n_trials = 100\n# data = np.random.binomial(1, 0.7, n_trials)\n\n# # Define the model\n# with pm.Model() as bernoulli_model:\n#     # Define the prior on p (Beta distribution with alpha=1, beta=1)\n#     p = pm.Beta('p', alpha=1, beta=1)\n    \n#     # Define the likelihood (Bernoulli distribution)\n#     y = pm.Bernoulli('y', p=p, observed=data)\n    \n#     # Perform inference\n#     trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, return_inferencedata=False)",

This will dilute the weight given to this concept in the book and potentially bias the results of the analysis.\n\n\nTo solve this issue, it is a common practice to use a stemming process, which will group together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item: the stem. In our On the Origin of Species example, the words related to the concept of selection would be gathered under the select stem.\n\n\nAs we are analysing 20 full books, the stemming algorithm can take several minutes to run and, in order to make the process faster, we will directly load the final results from a pickle file and review the method used to generate it.\n\n# Load the Porter stemming function from the nltk package\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n\n# Create an instance of a PorterStemmer object\nporter = PorterStemmer()\n\n# For each token of each text, we generated its stem \ntexts_stem = [[porter.stem(token) for token in text] for text in texts]\n\n# Save to pickle file\npickle.dump( texts_stem, open( \"datasets/texts_stem.p\", \"wb\" ) )\n\nimport pickle\n\n# Load the stemmed tokens list from the pregenerated pickle file\ntexts_stem = pickle.load(open( \"datasets/texts_stem.p\", \"rb\" ))\n\n# Print the 20 first stemmed tokens from the \"On the Origin of Species\" book\nprint(texts_stem[15][:20])\n\n['on', 'origin', 'speci', 'but', 'with', 'regard', 'materi', 'world', 'can', 'least', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'thi', 'can', 'perceiv', 'event', 'are', 'brought', 'about']",

We can, for example, see that topics such as selection, breeding or domestication are defining “On the Origin of Species” (and yes, in this book, Charles Darwin talks quite a lot about pigeons too). Now that we have a model associating tokens to how specific they are to each book, we can measure how related to books are between each other.\n\n\nTo this purpose, we will use a measure of similarity

    "text": "12. Which books have similar content?\n\nThis turns out to be extremely useful if we want to determine a given book’s most similar work. For example, we have just seen that if you enjoyed “On the Origin of Species,” you can read books discussing similar concepts such as “The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication” or “The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.” If you are familiar with Darwin’s work, these suggestions will likely seem natural to you. Indeed, On the Origin of Species has a whole chapter about domestication and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex applies the theory of natural selection to human evolution. Hence, the results make sense.\n\n\nHowever, we now want to have a better understanding of the big picture and see how Darwin’s books are generally related to each other (in terms of topics discussed). To this purpose, we will represent the whole similarity matrix as a dendrogram, which is a standard tool to display such data. This last approach will display all the information about book similarities at once. For example, we can find a book’s closest relative but, also, we can visualize which groups of books have similar topics (e.g., the cluster about Charles Darwin personal life with his autobiography and letters). If you are familiar with Darwin’s bibliography, the results should not surprise you too much, which indicates the method gives good results. Otherwise, next time you read one of the author’s book, you will know which other books to read next in order to learn more about the topics it addressed.\n\n\n# Import libraries\nfrom scipy.cluster import hierarchy\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap, rgb2hex\nfrom itertools import cycle\n\n\n# Plot prep\nc = cycle(plt.cm.tab10.colors)\nhierarchy.set_link_color_palette([rgb2hex(next(c)) for i in range(10)])\ncdict = {i: rgb2hex(plt.cm.tab10.colors[i]) for i in range(10)}\n\n\n# Obtain distance matrix and clustering\nZ = hierarchy.linkage(sim_df, 'ward')\nclusters = hierarchy.fcluster(Z, 0.7*2.5, criterion='distance')\n\n\n# Dimensionality reduction\npca = PCA(2)\nXrot = pca.fit_transform(sim_df)\n\n\n# Plotting PCA colored by cluster membership alongside dendrogram\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols = 2, figsize = (12, 5))\n\nax = axs[0]\nax.scatter(Xrot[:,0], Xrot[:,1], c = [cdict[cl-1] for cl in clusters])\nax.minorticks_on()\nax.grid(which='both', linestyle='--')\nax.axhline(0, color = 'k')\nax.axvline(0, color = 'k')\n\nax = axs[1]\na = hierarchy.dendrogram(Z,\n                         orientation='left', labels = sim_df.index,\n                         above_threshold_color='k',\n                        )\n\nplt.subplots_adjust(top=0.85)\n\nfig.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.90])\nfig.canvas.draw()\n\n\n\n\nDimensionality reduction and Clustering of Darwin’s literary work based on the TfIdf-cosine similarity Left panel shows the score plot of a projection to two-dimensional space using PCA, Right panel the result of",

Tokenizing the ingredients\n\nTo get to our end goal of comparing ingredients in each product, we first need to do some preprocessing tasks and bookkeeping of the actual words in each product’s ingredients list. The first step will be tokenizing the list of ingredients in Ingredients column. After splitting them into tokens, we’ll make a binary bag of words. Then we will create a dictionary with the tokens, ingredient_idx, which will have the following format:\n\n\n{ “ingredient”: index value, … }\n\n\n# Initialize dictionary, list, and initial index\ningredient_idx = {}\ncorpus = []\nidx = 0\n\n# For loop for tokenization\nfor i in range(len(moisturizers_dry)):    \n    ingredients = moisturizers_dry['Ingredients'][i]\n    ingredients_lower = ingredients.lower()\n    tokens = ingredients_lower.split(', ')\n    corpus.append(tokens)\n    for ingredient in tokens:\n        if ingredient not in ingredient_idx:\n            ingredient_idx[ingredient] = idx\n            idx += 1\n            \n# Check the result \nprint(\"The index for decyl oleate is\", ingredient_idx['decyl oleate'])\n\nThe index for decyl oleate is 25",

Here each cosmetic product will correspond to a document, and each chemical composition will correspond to a term. This means we can think of the matrix as a “cosmetic-ingredient” matrix. The size of the matrix should be as the picture shown below.  To create this matrix, we’ll first make an empty matrix filled with zeros. The length of the matrix is the total number of cosmetic products in the data. The width of the matrix is the total number of ingredients. After initializing this empty matrix, we’ll fill it in the following tasks.\n\n\n# Get the number of items and tokens \nM = moisturizers_dry.shape[0]\nN = len(ingredient_idx.keys())\n\n# Initialize a matrix of zeros\nA = np.zeros((M, N))",

Like mentioned above, t-SNE is a visualizing technique to plot high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space.

    "text": "Language plays a crucial role in shaping our perceptions and attitudes towards gender in the workplace, in classrooms, and personal relationships. Studies have shown that gender bias in language can have a significant impact on the way people are perceived and treated. For example, research has found that job advertisements that use masculine-coded language tend to attract more male applicants, while those that use feminine-coded language tend to attract more female applicants. Similarly, gendered language can perpetuate differences in the classroom.In this project, we’ll using scraped student reviews from ratemyprofessors.com to identify differences in language commonly used for male vs. female professors, and explore subtleties in how language in the classroom can be gendered.This excellent tool created by Ben Schmidt allows us to enter the words and phrases that we find in our analysis and explore them in more depth. We’ll do this at the end.Catalyst also does some incredible work on decoding gendered language."

    "text": "Task 3d. What are the most important words being used to describe professors in reviews?\nLet’s write a custom function that tokenizes and lemmatizes our list of words.- Word tokenization: process of splitting text into individual words, called tokens. A common preprocessing step in natural language processing (NLP) so that text can be analyzed and processed more easily. Methods include whitespace tokenization, regular expression-based tokenization, and rule-based tokenization. We’ll be using the word_tokenize tokenizer from nltk, with all its defaults.- Lemmatization: process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form, called the lemma. Also a common pre-processing step in NLP, so that words with a common base form are treated the same way. For example, the lemma of “am” is “be”, of “running” is “run”, and of “mice” is “mouse”.\n\ndef tokenize(text):    tk = WhitespaceTokenizer()    tokens = tk.tokenize(text)    stems = []    for item in tokens:        stems.append(PorterStemmer().stem(item))    return stems    # return tokens\n\nLet’s import a list of stop words, which are common English words that we will be ignoring in our analysis. sklearn provides a common list of stop words, and we can append additional words to this list. Below, we append pronouns, along with the words “class” and “student”.\n\nmy_stop_words = text.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS.union([\"he\",\"she\",\"his\",\"her\",                                              \"himself\",\"herself\", \"hers\",\"shes\"                                              \"class\",\"student\"])\n\nFor the purpose of analyzing review texts, we want to move from having one row for each professor to one row for each review. Lets do this with .explode() from pandas.\n\ndf_quality = df[(df['review'].apply(len) == df['quality'].apply(len))]q = df_quality[['pronouns','review','quality']].explode(['review','quality'], ignore_index=True).dropna()q['quality'] = q['quality'].astype(float)\n\nTFIDF vectorization is the process of assigning scores to each review in a document based on how frequently the word occurs, normalized by how frequently the word occurs in the dataset overall.We’ll use TfidfVectorizer() to generate these scores. This will return a matrix, with as many rows as reviews, and as many columns as words in our dataset.\n\nvec = TfidfVectorizer(tokenizer=tokenize, stop_words=my_stop_words,                     ngram_range=(1,4))X = vec.fit_transform(q['review'])feature_names = vec.get_feature_names_out()\n\nX is a sparse matrix. We’ll now move into filtering X for:- Male professors only- Female professors only- Rows with male professors and reviews of high quality - Rows with female professors and reviews of high quality - Rows with male professors and reviews of low quality - Rows with female professors and reviews of low quality We can explore feature importance in each of these to get a sense of which words and phrases are coming up most often in the data.\n\nm_pos = X[(q['pronouns']=='M') & (q['quality']&gt;=4.5),:] f_pos = X[(q['pronouns']=='F') & (q['quality']&gt;=4.5),:] m_neg = X[(q['pronouns']=='M') & (q['quality']&lt;2.5),:] f_neg = X[(q['pronouns']=='M') & (q['quality']&lt;2.5),:] \n\nLet’s have a look at what language students are using to describe male professors positively.

For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.\nAll feature values are recoded with four significant digits.\nMissing attribute values: none\nClass distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant\n\n\nTask 1: Loading Libraries and Data\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns  # data visualization library  \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport time\n\n\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\nsns.set_style('white')\nsns.set_context('talk')\n\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/data.csv').drop(['Unnamed: 32'], axis = 1)\n\n\ndf.columns\n\nIndex(['id', 'diagnosis', 'radius_mean', 'texture_mean', 'perimeter_mean',\n       'area_mean', 'smoothness_mean', 'compactness_mean', 'concavity_mean',\n       'concave points_mean', 'symmetry_mean', 'fractal_dimension_mean',\n       'radius_se', 'texture_se', 'perimeter_se', 'area_se', 'smoothness_se',\n       'compactness_se', 'concavity_se', 'concave points_se', 'symmetry_se',\n       'fractal_dimension_se', 'radius_worst', 'texture_worst',\n       'perimeter_worst', 'area_worst', 'smoothness_worst',\n       'compactness_worst', 'concavity_worst', 'concave points_worst',\n       'symmetry_worst', 'fractal_dimension_worst', 'Unnamed: 32'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Separate Target from Features\n\nNote: If you are starting the notebook from this task, you can run cells from all the previous tasks in the kernel by going to the top menu and Kernel &gt;

    "text": "Note: You can consult the solution of this live training in the file browser as notebook-solution.ipynb\nLanguage plays a crucial role in shaping our perceptions and attitudes towards gender in the workplace, in classrooms, and personal relationships. Studies have shown that gender bias in language can have a significant impact on the way people are perceived and treated.\nFor example, research has found that job advertisements that use masculine-coded language tend to attract more male applicants, while those that use feminine-coded language tend to attract more female applicants. Similarly, gendered language can perpetuate differences in the classroom.\nIn this project, we’ll using scraped student reviews from ratemyprofessors.com to identify differences in language commonly used for male vs. female professors, and explore subtleties in how language in the classroom can be gendered.\nThis excellent tool created by Ben Schmidt allows us to enter the words and phrases that we find in our analysis and explore them in more depth. We’ll do this at the end.\nCatalyst also does some incredible work on decoding gendered language.",

    "text": "Task 3d. What are the most important words being used to describe professors in reviews?\nLet’s write a custom function that tokenizes and lemmatizes our list of words. - Word tokenization: process of splitting text into individual words, called tokens. A common preprocessing step in natural language processing (NLP) so that text can be analyzed and processed more easily. Methods include whitespace tokenization, regular expression-based tokenization, and rule-based tokenization. We’ll be using the word_tokenize tokenizer from nltk, with all its defaults. - Lemmatization: process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form, called the lemma. Also a common pre-processing step in NLP, so that words with a common base form are treated the same way. For example, the lemma of “am” is “be”, of “running” is “run”, and of “mice” is “mouse”.\n\nPorterStemmer().stem(\"she\\'s\")\n\n\"she'\"\n\n\n\nword_tokenize('she\\'s a girl')\n\n['she', \"'s\", 'a', 'girl']\n\n\n\nimport string\n\n\ndef tokenize(text):\n    tk = WhitespaceTokenizer()\n    tokens = tk.tokenize(text)\n    stems = []\n    for item in tokens:\n        stems.append(PorterStemmer().stem(item).strip(string.punctuation))\n    return stems\n\nLet’s import a list of stop words, which are common English words that we will be ignoring in our analysis. sklearn provides a common list of stop words, and we can append additional words to this list.

    "text": "manufacturing gears\nManufacturing processes for any product is like putting together a puzzle. Products are pieced together step by step, and keeping a close eye on the process is important.\nFor this project, you’re supporting a team that wants to improve how they monitor and control a manufacturing process. The goal is to implement a more methodical approach known as statistical process control (SPC). SPC is an established strategy that uses data to determine whether the process works well. Processes are only adjusted if measurements fall outside of an acceptable range.\nThis acceptable range is defined by an upper control limit (UCL) and a lower control limit (LCL), the formulas for which are:\n\\(ucl = avg\\_height + 3 * \\frac{stddev\\_height}{\\sqrt{5}}\\)\n\\(lcl = avg\\_height - 3 * \\frac{stddev\\_height}{\\sqrt{5}}\\)\nThe UCL defines the highest acceptable height for the parts, while the LCL defines the lowest acceptable height for the parts. Ideally, parts should fall between the two limits.\nUsing SQL window functions and nested queries, you’ll analyze historical manufacturing data to define this acceptable range and identify any points in the process that fall outside of the range and therefore require adjustments. This will ensure a smooth running manufacturing process consistently making high-quality products.",

Hence, we must convert our textual plot summaries to numbers for the computer to be able to extract meaning from them. One simple method of doing this would be to count all the occurrences of each word in the entire vocabulary and return the counts in a vector. Enter CountVectorizer.\n\n\nConsider the word ‘the’. It appears quite frequently in almost all movie plots and will have a high count in each case. But obviously, it isn’t the theme of all the movies! Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is one method which overcomes the shortcomings of CountVectorizer. The Term Frequency of a word is the measure of how often it appears in a document, while the Inverse Document Frequency is the parameter which reduces the importance of a word if it frequently appears in several documents.\n\n\nFor example, when we apply the TF-IDF on the first 3 sentences from the plot of The Wizard of Oz, we are told that the most important word there is ‘Toto’, the pet dog of the lead character. This is because the movie begins with ‘Toto’ biting someone due to which the journey of Oz begins!\n\n\nIn simplest terms, TF-IDF recognizes words which are unique and important to any given document.

To do this, we use the fit_transform() method of the TfidfVectorizer object.\n\n\nIf we observe the TfidfVectorizer object we created, we come across a parameter stopwords. ‘stopwords’ are those words in a given text which do not contribute considerably towards the meaning of the sentence and are generally grammatical filler words. For example, in the sentence ‘Dorothy Gale lives with her dog Toto on the farm of her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry’, we could drop the words ‘her’ and ‘the’, and still have a similar overall meaning to the sentence. Thus, ‘her’ and ‘the’ are stopwords and can be conveniently dropped from the sentence.\n\n\nOn setting the stopwords to ‘english’, we direct the vectorizer to drop all stopwords from a pre-defined list of English language stopwords present in the nltk module.

    "text": "8. Import KMeans and create clusters\n\nTo determine how closely one movie is related to the other by the help of unsupervised learning, we can use clustering techniques. Clustering is the method of grouping together a number of items such that they exhibit similar properties. According to the measure of similarity desired, a given sample of items can have one or more clusters.\n\n\nA good basis of clustering in our dataset could be the genre of the movies. Say we could have a cluster ‘0’ which holds movies of the ‘Drama’ genre. We would expect movies like Chinatown or Psycho to belong to this cluster. Similarly, the cluster ‘1’ in this project holds movies which belong to the ‘Adventure’ genre (Lawrence of Arabia and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, for example).\n\n\nK-means is an algorithm which helps us to implement clustering in Python. The name derives from its method of implementation: the given sample is divided into K clusters where each cluster is denoted by the mean of all the items lying in that cluster.\n\n\nWe get the following distribution for the clusters:\n\n\n\n\n\n# Import k-means to perform clusters\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\n# Create a KMeans object with 5 clusters and save as km\nkm = KMeans(n_clusters=5)\n\n# Fit the k-means object with tfidf_matrix\nkm.fit(tfidf_matrix)\n\nclusters = km.labels_.tolist()\n\n# Create a column cluster to denote the generated cluster for each movie\nmovies_df[\"cluster\"] = clusters\n\n# Display number of films per cluster (clusters from 0 to 4)\nmovies_df['cluster'].value_counts() \n\ncluster\n1    38\n2    27\n3    18\n4    14\n0     3\nName: count, dtype: int64",

    "text": "9. Calculate similarity distance\n\nConsider the following two sentences from the movie The Wizard of Oz:\n\n\n\n“they find in the Emerald City”\n\n\n“they finally reach the Emerald City”\n\n\n\nIf we put the above sentences in a CountVectorizer, the vocabulary produced would be “they, find, in, the, Emerald, City, finally, reach” and the vectors for each sentence would be as follows:\n\n\n\n1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0\n\n\n1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\n\n\nWhen we calculate the cosine angle formed between the vectors represented by the above, we get a score of 0.667. This means the above sentences are very closely related. Similarity distance is 1 - cosine similarity angle. This follows from that if the vectors are similar, the cosine of their angle would be 1 and hence, the distance between then would be 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n\nLet’s calculate the similarity distance for all of our movies.\n\n\n# Import cosine_similarity to calculate similarity of movie plots\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\n# Calculate the similarity distance\nsimilarity_distance = 1 - cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix)",

Import Matplotlib, Linkage, and Dendrograms\n\nWe shall now create a tree-like diagram (called a dendrogram) of the movie titles to help us understand the level of similarity between them visually. Dendrograms help visualize the results of hierarchical clustering, which is an alternative to k-means clustering. Two pairs of movies at the same level of hierarchical clustering are expected to have similar strength of similarity between the corresponding pairs of movies. For example, the movie Fargo would be as similar to North By Northwest as the movie Platoon is to Saving Private Ryan, given both the pairs exhibit the same level of the hierarchy.\n\n\nLet’s import the modules we’ll need to create our dendrogram.\n\n\n# Import matplotlib.pyplot for plotting graphs\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Configure matplotlib to display the output inline\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Import modules necessary to plot dendrogram\nfrom scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram",

    "text": "In CASE of rivalry\nBarcelona and Real Madrid have been rival teams for more than 80 years. Matches between these two teams are given the name El Clásico (The Classic). In this exercise, you will query a list of matches played between these two rivals.\nYou will notice in Step 2 that when you have multiple logical conditions in a CASE statement, you may quickly end up with a large number of WHEN clauses to logically test every outcome you are interested in. It’s important to make sure you don’t accidentally exclude key information in your ELSE clause.\nIn this exercise, you will retrieve information about matches played between Barcelona (id = 8634) and Real Madrid (id = 8633). Note that the query you are provided with already identifies the Clásico matches using a filter in the WHERE clause.\n\n\n\n\nComplete the first CASE statement, identifying Barcelona or Real Madrid as the home team using the hometeam_id column.\nComplete the second CASE statement in the same way, using awayteam_id.\n\n\n\n\nSELECT \n    date,\n    -- Identify the home team as Barcelona or Real Madrid\n    CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' \n         ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END AS home,\n    -- Identify the away team as Barcelona or Real Madrid\n    CASE WHEN awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' \n         ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END AS away\nFROM matches_spain\nWHERE (awayteam_id = 8634 OR hometeam_id = 8634)\n      AND (awayteam_id = 8633 OR hometeam_id = 8633);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct the final CASE statement identifying who won each match. Note there are 3 possible outcomes, but 5 conditions that you need to identify.\nFill in the logical operators to identify Barcelona or Real Madrid as the winner.\n\n\n\n\nSELECT \n    date,\n    CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' \n         ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END as home,\n    CASE WHEN awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' \n         ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END as away,\n    -- Identify all possible match outcomes\n    CASE    WHEN home_goal &gt; away_goal AND hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'Barcelona win!'\n                WHEN home_goal &gt; away_goal AND hometeam_id = 8633 THEN 'Real Madrid win!'\n                WHEN home_goal &lt; away_goal AND awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'Barcelona win!'\n                WHEN home_goal &lt; away_goal AND awayteam_id = 8633 THEN 'Real Madrid win!'\n        ELSE 'Tie!' END as outcome\nFROM matches_spain\nWHERE (awayteam_id = 8634 OR hometeam_id = 8634)\n      AND (awayteam_id = 8633 OR hometeam_id = 8633);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s generate a list of matches won by Italy’s Bologna team! There are quite a few additional teams in the two tables, so a key part of generating a usable query will be using your CASE statement as a filter in the WHERE clause.\n\n\nCASE statements allow you to categorize data that you’re interested in – and exclude data you’re not interested in. In order to do this, you can use a CASE statement as a filter in the WHERE statement to remove output you don’t want to see.\n\n\nHere is how you might set that up:\n\nSELECT *\nFROM table\nWHERE \n    CASE WHEN a &gt; 5 THEN 'Keep'\n         WHEN a &lt;= 5 THEN 'Exclude' END = 'Keep';\n\n\nIn essence, you can use the CASE statement as a filtering column like any other column in your database. The only difference is that you don’t alias the statement in WHERE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify Bologna’s team ID listed in the teams_italy table by selecting the team_long_name and team_api_id.\n\n\n\n\n-- Select team_long_name and team_api_id from team\nSELECT\n    team_long_name,\n    team_api_id\nFROM teams_italy\n-- Filter for team long name\nWHERE team_long_name = 'Bologna';\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the season and date that a match was played\nComplete the CASE statement so that only Bologna’s home and away wins are identified.\n\n\n\n\n-- Select the season and date columns\nSELECT \n    season,\n    date,\n    -- Identify when Bologna won a match\n    CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 \n        AND home_goal &gt; away_goal \n        THEN 'Bologna Win'\n        WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 \n        AND away_goal &gt; home_goal \n        THEN 'Bologna Win' \n        END AS outcome\nFROM matches_italy;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the home_goal and away_goal for each match.\n\n\nUse the CASE statement in the WHERE clause to filter all NULL values generated by the statement in the previous step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- Select the season, date, home_goal, and away_goal columns\nSELECT \n    season,\n    date,\n    home_goal,\n    away_goal\nFROM matches_italy\nWHERE \n-- Exclude games not won by Bologna\n    CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 AND home_goal &gt; away_goal THEN 'Bologna Win'\n        WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 AND away_goal &gt; home_goal THEN 'Bologna Win' \n        END IS NOT NULL;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo the number of soccer matches played in a given European country differ across seasons? We will use the European Soccer Database to answer this question.\n\n\nYou will examine the number of matches played in 3 seasons within each country listed in the database. This is much easier to explore with each season’s matches in separate columns. Using the country and unfiltered match table, you will count the number of matches played in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 match seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a CASE statement that identifies the id of matches played in the 2012/2013 season. Specify that you want ELSE values to be NULL.\n\n\nWrap the CASE statement in a COUNT function and group the query by the country alias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Hint (-15 XP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT \n    c.name AS country,\n    -- Count games from the 2012/2013 season\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' \n            THEN m.id ELSE NULL END) AS matches_2012_2013\nFROM country AS c\nLEFT JOIN match AS m\nON c.id = m.country_id\n-- Group by country name alias\nGROUP BY c.name;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate 3 CASE WHEN statements counting the matches played in each country across the 3 seasons.\n\n\nEND your CASE statement without an ELSE clause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT \n    c.name AS country,\n    -- Count matches in each of the 3 seasons\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2012_2013,\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2013_2014,\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2014_2015\nFROM country AS c\nLEFT JOIN match AS m\nON c.id = m.country_id\n-- Group by country name alias\nGROUP BY c.name;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R or Python, you have the ability to calculate a SUM of logical values (i.e., TRUE/FALSE) directly. In SQL, you have to convert these values into 1 and 0 before calculating a sum. This can be done using a CASE statement.\n\n\nThere’s one key difference when using SUM to aggregate logical values compared to using COUNT in the previous exercise –\n\n\nYour goal here is to use the country and match table to determine the total number of matches won by the home team in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate 3 CASE statements to “count” matches in the ‘2012/2013’, ‘2013/2014’, and ‘2014/2015’ seasons, respectively.\n\n\nHave each CASE statement return a 1 for every match you want to include, and a 0 for every match to exclude.\n\n\nWrap the CASE statement in a SUM to return the total matches played in each season.\n\n\nGroup the query by the country name alias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT \n    c.name AS country,\n    -- Sum the total records in each season where the home team won\n    SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' AND m.home_goal &gt; m.away_goal \n        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2012_2013,\n        SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' AND m.home_goal &gt; m.away_goal\n        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2013_2014,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' AND m.home_goal &gt; m.away_goal\n        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2014_2015\nFROM country AS c\nLEFT JOIN match AS m\nON c.id = m.country_id\n-- Group by country name alias\nGROUP BY c.name;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASE statements will return any value you specify in your THEN clause. This is an incredibly powerful tool for robust calculations and data manipulation when used in conjunction with an aggregate statement. One key task you can perform is using CASE inside an AVG function to calculate a percentage of information in your database.\n\n\nHere’s an example of how you set that up:\n\nAVG(CASE WHEN condition_is_met THEN 1\n         WHEN condition_is_not_met THEN 0 END)\n\n\nWith this approach, it’s important to accurately specify which records count as 0, otherwise your calculations may not be correct!\n\n\nYour task is to examine the number of wins, losses, and ties in each country.

But how might that impact the performance of your query? Complete the following steps and let’s find out!\n\n\nPlease note that your query will run more slowly than the previous exercise!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a correlated subquery in the SELECT statement, match the team_api_id column from team to the hometeam_id from match.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT\n    m.date,\n   (SELECT team_long_name\n    FROM team AS t\n    -- Connect the team to the match table\n    WHERE t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id) AS hometeam\nFROM match AS m;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a second correlated subquery in SELECT, yielding the away team’s name.\n\n\nSelect the home and away goal columns from match in the main query.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT\n    m.date,\n    (SELECT team_long_name\n     FROM team AS t\n     WHERE t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id) AS hometeam,\n    -- Connect the team to the match table\n    (SELECT team_long_name\n     FROM team AS t\n     WHERE t.team_api_id = m.awayteam_id) AS awayteam,\n    -- Select home and away goals\n     m.home_goal,\n     m.away_goal\nFROM match AS m;\n\n\n\n\n\nCTEs\n\n\nYou’ve now explored two methods for answering the question, How do you get both the home and away team names into one final query result?\n\n\nLet’s explore the final method - common table expressions. Common table expressions are similar to the subquery method for generating results, mainly differing in syntax and the order in which information is processed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect id from match and team_long_name from team. Join these two tables together on hometeam_id in match and team_api_id in team.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT \n    -- Select match id and team long name\n    m.id, \n    team_long_name AS hometeam\nFROM match AS m\n-- Join team to match using team_api_id and hometeam_id\nLEFT JOIN team AS t \nON t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeclare the query from the previous step as a common table expression. SELECT everything from the CTE into the main query. Your results will not change at this step!\n\n\n\n\n\n-- Declare the home CTE\nWITH home AS (\n    SELECT m.id, t.team_long_name AS hometeam\n    FROM match AS m\n    LEFT JOIN team AS t \n    ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id)\n-- Select everything from home\nSELECT *\nFROM home;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s declare the second CTE, away. Join it to the first CTE on the id column.\n\n\nThe date, home_goal, and away_goal columns have been added to the CTEs.

    "text": "Probabilistic Model\nThe model assumes a “switch point” (e.g. a year during which safety regulations changed), and Poisson-distributed disaster rate with constant (but potentially different) rates before and after that switch point.\nThe actual disaster count is fixed (observed); any sample of this model will need to specify both the switchpoint and the “early” and “late” rate of disasters.\nOriginal model from pymc3 documentation example:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(D_t|s,e,l)&\\sim \\text{Poisson}(r_t), \\\\\n  & \\,\\quad\\text{with}\\; r_t = \\begin{cases}e & \\text{if}\\; t &lt; s\\\\l &\\text{if}\\; t \\ge s\\end{cases} \\\\\ns&\\sim\\text{Discrete Uniform}(t_l,\\,t_h) \\\\\ne&\\sim\\text{Exponential}(r_e)\\\\\nl&\\sim\\text{Exponential}(r_l)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nHowever, the mean disaster rate \\(r_t\\) has a discontinuity at the switchpoint \\(s\\), which makes it not differentiable. Thus it provides no gradient signal to the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm – but because the \\(s\\) prior is continuous, HMC’s fallback to a random walk is good enough to find the areas of high probability mass in this example.\nAs a second model, we modify the original model using a sigmoid “switch” between e and l to make the transition differentiable, and use a continuous uniform distribution for the switchpoint \\(s\\). (One could argue this model is more true to reality, as a “switch” in mean rate would likely be stretched out over multiple years.) The new model is thus:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(D_t|s,e,l)&\\sim\\text{Poisson}(r_t), \\\\\n& \\,\\quad \\text{with}\\; r_t = e + \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(s-t)}(l-e) \\\\\ns&\\sim\\text{Uniform}(t_l,\\,t_h) \\\\\ne&\\sim\\text{Exponential}(r_e)\\\\\nl&\\sim\\text{Exponential}(r_l)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIn the absence of more information we assume \\(r_e = r_l = 1\\) as parameters for the priors.

The disaster_rate functions are called with an array of [0, ..., len(years)-1] to produce a vector of len(years) random variables – the years before the switchpoint are early_disaster_rate, the ones after late_disaster_rate (modulo the sigmoid transition).\nHere is a sanity-check that the target log prob function is sane:\n\ndef target_log_prob_fn(model, s, e, l):\n  return model.log_prob(s=s, e=e, l=l, d_t=disaster_data)\n\nmodels = [model_switch, model_sigmoid]\nprint([target_log_prob_fn(m, 40., 3., .9).numpy() for m in models])  # Somewhat likely result\nprint([target_log_prob_fn(m, 60., 1., 5.).numpy() for m in models])  # Rather unlikely result\nprint([target_log_prob_fn(m, -10., 1., 1.).numpy() for m in models]) # Impossible result\n\n[-176.9456, -176.28719]\n[-371.3125, -366.8816]\n[-inf, -inf]"

To select columns from both the film and rental tables in a single query, we’ll need to use the inventory table to join these two tables together since there is no explicit relationship between them. Let’s give it a try!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtract the rental_date from the return_date to calculate the number of days_rented.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT f.title, f.rental_duration,\n    -- Calculate the number of days rented\n    r.return_date - r.rental_date AS days_rented\nFROM film AS f\n     INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id\n     INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id\nORDER BY f.title;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow use the AGE() function to calculate the days_rented.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT f.title, f.rental_duration,\n    -- Calculate the number of days rented\n    AGE(r.return_date, r.rental_date) AS days_rented\nFROM film AS f\n    INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id\n    INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id\nORDER BY f.title;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\nrental_duration\n\n\ndays_rented\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3\n\n\n1 day, 2:09:00\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3\n\n\n6 days, 19:30:00\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3\n\n\nnull\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3\n\n\n8 days, 0:02:00\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3\n\n\n3 days, 1:12:00\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3\n\n\n8 days, 0:08:00\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3\n\n\n6 days, 21:32:00\n\n\n\n\nADAPTATION HOLES\n\n\n7\n\n\n5 days, 23:34:00\n\n\n\n\nADAPTATION HOLES\n\n\n7\n\n\n2 days, 19:12:00\n\n\n\n\nADAPTATION HOLES\n\n\n7\n\n\n1 day, 21:03:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterval arithmetic\n\n\nIf you were running a real DVD Rental store, there would be times when you would need to determine what film titles were currently out for rental with customers. In the previous exercise, we saw that some of the records in the results had a NULL value for the return_date. This is because the rental was still outstanding.\n\n\nEach rental in the film table has an associated rental_duration column which represents the number of days that a DVD can be rented by a customer before it is considered late. In this example, you will exclude films that have a NULL value for the return_date and also convert the rental_duration to an INTERVAL type. Here’s a reminder of one method for performing this conversion.\n\nSELECT INTERVAL '1' day * timestamp '2019-04-10 12:34:56'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert rental_duration by multiplying it with a 1 day INTERVAL\n\n\nSubtract the rental_date from the return_date to calculate the number of days_rented.\n\n\nExclude rentals with a NULL value for return_date.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT\n    f.title,\n    -- Convert the rental_duration to an interval\n    INTERVAL '1' DAY * f.rental_duration,\n    -- Calculate the days rented as we did previously\n    r.return_date - r.rental_date AS days_rented\nFROM film AS f\n    INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id\n    INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id\n-- Filter the query to exclude outstanding rentals\nWHERE r.return_date IS NOT NULL\nORDER BY f.title;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\n?column?\n\n\ndays_rented\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3 days, 0:00:00\n\n\n6 days, 19:30:00\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3 days, 0:00:00\n\n\n6 days, 21:32:00\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3 days, 0:00:00\n\n\n8 days, 0:02:00\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3 days, 0:00:00\n\n\n1 day, 2:09:00\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3 days, 0:00:00\n\n\n3 days, 1:12:00\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n3 days, 0:00:00\n\n\n8 days, 0:08:00\n\n\n\n\nADAPTATION HOLES\n\n\n7 days, 0:00:00\n\n\n5 days, 23:34:00\n\n\n\n\nADAPTATION HOLESs\n\n\n7 days, 0:00:00\n\n\n2 days, 19:12:00\n\n\n\n\nADAPTATION HOLES\n\n\n7 days, 0:00:00\n\n\n1 day, 21:03:00\n\n\n\n\nADAPTATION HOLES\n\n\n7 days, 0:00:00\n\n\n21:30:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the expected return date\n\n\nSo now that you’ve practiced how to add and subtract timestamps and perform relative calculations using intervals, let’s use those new skills to calculate the actual expected return date of a specific rental. As you’ve seen in previous exercises, the rental_duration is the number of days allowed for a rental before it’s considered late. To calculate the expected_return_date you will want to use the rental_duration and add it to the rental_date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert rental_duration by multiplying it with a 1-day INTERVAL.\n\n\nAdd it to the rental date.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT\n    f.title,\n    r.rental_date,\n    f.rental_duration,\n    -- Add the rental duration to the rental date\n    INTERVAL '1' day * f.rental_duration + r.rental_date AS expected_return_date,\n    r.return_date\nFROM film AS f\n    INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id\n    INNER JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id\nORDER BY f.title;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\nrental_date\n\n\nrental_duration\n\n\nexpected_return_date\n\n\nreturn_date\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n2005-07-07 19:46:51\n\n\n3\n\n\n2005-07-10 19:46:51\n\n\n2005-07-08 21:55:51\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n2005-08-17 09:33:02\n\n\n3\n\n\n2005-08-20 09:33:02\n\n\n2005-08-24 05:03:02\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n2006-02-14 15:16:03\n\n\n3\n\n\n2006-02-17 15:16:03\n\n\nnull\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n2005-08-22 16:59:05\n\n\n3\n\n\n2005-08-25 16:59:05\n\n\n2005-08-30 17:01:05\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n2005-08-01 04:24:47\n\n\n3\n\n\n2005-08-04 04:24:47\n\n\n2005-08-04 05:36:47\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n2005-07-28 05:04:47\n\n\n3\n\n\n2005-07-31 05:04:47\n\n\n2005-08-05 05:12:47\n\n\n\n\nACE GOLDFINGER\n\n\n2005-08-02 04:41:17\n\n\n3\n\n\n2005-08-05 04:41:17\n\n\n2005-08-09 02:13:17\n\n\n\n\nADAPTATION HOLES\n\n\n2005-07-06 22:01:51\n\n\n7\n\n\n2005-07-13 22:01:51\n\n\n2005-07-12 21:35:51\n\n\n\n\nADAPTATION HOLES\n\n\n2005-07-27 01:21:19\n\n\n7\n\n\n2005-08-03 01:21:19\n\n\n2005-07-29 20:33:19\n\n\n\n\nADAPTATION HOLES\n\n\n2005-05-31 04:50:07\n\n\n7\n\n\n2005-06-07 04:50:07\n\n\n2005-06-02 01:53:07"

For example\n\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', TIMESTAMP '2005-05-21 15:30:30');\n\n\nResult: 2005-05-01 00;00:00\n\n\nNow, let’s experiment with different precisions and ultimately modify the queries from the previous exercises to aggregate rental activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nTruncate the rental_date field by year.\n\n\n\n\n-- Truncate rental_date by year\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('year', rental_date) AS rental_year\nFROM rental;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrental_year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2005-01-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-01-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-01-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-01-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-01-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-01-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-01-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-01-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-01-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-01-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow modify the previous query to truncate the rental_date by month.\n\n\n\n\n-- Truncate rental_date by month\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', rental_date) AS rental_month\nFROM rental;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrental_month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-01 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see what happens when we truncate by day of the month.\n\n\n\n\n-- Truncate rental_date by day of the month \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', rental_date) AS rental_day \nFROM rental;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrental_day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-24 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-24 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-24 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-24 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-24 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-24 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-24 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-24 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-25 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-25 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-25 00:00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, count the total number of rentals by rental_day and alias it as rentals.\n\n\n\n\nSELECT \n  DATE_TRUNC('day', rental_date) AS rental_day,\n  -- Count total number of rentals \n  COUNT(*) AS rentals\nFROM rental\nGROUP BY 1;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrental_day\n\n\nrentals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-28 00:00:00\n\n\n196\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-25 00:00:00\n\n\n137\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-29 00:00:00\n\n\n154\n\n\n\n\n2005-08-16 00:00:00\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n2005-05-31 00:00:00\n\n\n163\n\n\n\n\n2005-07-11 00:00:00\n\n\n461\n\n\n\n\n2005-07-10 00:00:00\n\n\n480\n\n\n\n\n2005-06-18 00:00:00\n\n\n344\n\n\n\n\n2005-07-31 00:00:00\n\n\n679\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\nMany of the techniques you’ve learned in this course will be useful when building queries to extract data for model training. Now let’s use some date/time functions to extract and manipulate some DVD rentals data from our fictional DVD rental store.\n\n\nIn this exercise, you are going to extract a list of customers and their rental history over 90 days. You will be using the EXTRACT(), DATE_TRUNC(), and AGE() functions that you learned about during this chapter along with some general SQL skills from the prerequisites to extract a data set that could be used to determine what day of the week customers are most likely to rent a DVD and the likelihood that they will return the DVD late.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract the day of the week from the rental_date column using the alias dayofweek.\n\n\nUse an INTERVAL in the WHERE clause to select records for the 90 day period starting on 5/1/2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT \n  -- Extract the day of week date part from the rental_date\n  EXTRACT(dow from rental_date) AS dayofweek,\n  AGE(return_date, rental_date) AS rental_days\nFROM rental AS r \nWHERE \n  -- Use an INTERVAL for the upper bound of the rental_date \n  rental_date BETWEEN CAST('2005-05-01' AS date)\n   AND CAST('2005-05-01' AS date) + INTERVAL '90 day';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndayofweek\n\n\nrental_days\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n1 day, 23:11:00\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n3 days, 20:46:00\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n7 days, 23:09:00\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n9 days, 2:39:00\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n8 days, 5:28:00\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2 days, 2:24:00\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n4 days, 21:23:00\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n3 days, 0:02:00\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n3 days, 0:22:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, use a CASE statement and DATE_TRUNC() to create a new column called past_due which will be TRUE if the rental_days is greater than the rental_duration otherwise, it will be FALSE.\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT \n  c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS customer_name,\n  f.title,\n  r.rental_date,\n  -- Extract the day of week date part from the rental_date\n  EXTRACT(dow FROM r.rental_date) AS dayofweek,\n  AGE(r.return_date, r.rental_date) AS rental_days,\n  -- Use DATE_TRUNC to get days from the AGE function\n  CASE WHEN DATE_TRUNC('day', AGE(r.return_date, r.rental_date)) &gt; \n  -- Calculate number of d\n    f.rental_duration * INTERVAL '1' day \n  THEN TRUE \n  ELSE FALSE END AS past_due \nFROM \n  film AS f \n  INNER JOIN inventory AS i \n    ON f.film_id = i.film_id \n  INNER JOIN rental AS r \n    ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id \n  INNER JOIN customer AS c \n    ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id \nWHERE \n  -- Use an INTERVAL for the upper bound of the rental_date \n  r.rental_date BETWEEN CAST('2005-05-01' AS DATE) \n  AND CAST('2005-05-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 day';\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncustomer_name\n\n\ntitle\n\n\nrental_date\n\n\ndayofweek\n\n\nrental_days\n\n\npast_due\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHARLOTTE HUNTER\n\n\nBLANKET BEVERLY\n\n\n2005-05-24 22:53:30\n\n\n2\n\n\n1 day, 23:11:00\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\nTOMMY COLLAZO\n\n\nFREAKY POCUS\n\n\n2005-05-24 22:54:33\n\n\n2\n\n\n3 days, 20:46:00\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\nMANUEL MURRELL\n\n\nGRADUATE LORD\n\n\n2005-05-24 23:03:39\n\n\n2\n\n\n7 days, 23:09:00\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\nANDREW PURDY\n\n\nLOVE SUICIDES\n\n\n2005-05-24 23:04:41\n\n\n2\n\n\n9 days, 2:39:00\n\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\nDELORES HANSEN\n\n\nIDOLS SNATCHERS\n\n\n2005-05-24 23:05:21\n\n\n2\n\n\n8 days, 5:28:00\n\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\nNELSON CHRISTENSON\n\n\nMYSTIC TRUMAN\n\n\n2005-05-24 23:08:07\n\n\n2\n\n\n2 days, 2:24:00\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\nCASSANDRA WALTERS\n\n\nSWARM GOLD\n\n\n2005-05-24 23:11:53\n\n\n2\n\n\n4 days, 21:23:00\n\n\nfalse"

Note that the duration column has missing values.\nChain a new data.table expression that replaces all missing values in duration with the corresponding mean_dur value.\nDelete the mean_dur column by reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nbatrips_new &lt;- batrips\nbatrips_new[sample(seq(1:.N), 100), duration := NA]\n\n# Calculate the mean duration for each month\nbatrips_new[, mean_dur := mean(na.omit(duration)), \n            by = month(start_date)][1:5,]\n\n   trip_id duration          start_date           start_station start_terminal\n     &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;              &lt;POSc&gt;                  &lt;char&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1:  139545      435 2014-01-01 00:14:00 San Francisco City Hall             58\n2:  139546      432 2014-01-01 00:14:00 San Francisco City Hall             58\n3:  139547     1523 2014-01-01 00:17:00  Embarcadero at Sansome             60\n4:  139549     1620 2014-01-01 00:23:00       Steuart at Market             74\n5:  139550     1617 2014-01-01 00:23:00       Steuart at Market             74\n              end_date        end_station end_terminal bike_id\n                &lt;POSc&gt;             &lt;char&gt;        &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1: 2014-01-01 00:21:00    Townsend at 7th           65     473\n2: 2014-01-01 00:21:00    Townsend at 7th           65     395\n3: 2014-01-01 00:42:00    Beale at Market           56     331\n4: 2014-01-01 00:50:00 Powell Street BART           39     605\n5: 2014-01-01 00:50:00 Powell Street BART           39     453\n   subscription_type zip_code trips_N duration_mean mean_dur\n              &lt;char&gt;   &lt;char&gt;   &lt;int&gt;         &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1:        Subscriber    94612    2145      678.6364 1013.945\n2:        Subscriber    94107    2145      678.6364 1013.945\n3:        Subscriber    94112   12879      651.2367 1013.945\n4:          Customer    92007   11579      883.9379 1013.945\n5:          Customer    92007   11579      883.9379 1013.945\n\n# Replace NA values in duration with the mean value of duration for that month\nbatrips_new[, mean_dur := mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE), \n            by = month(start_date)][is.na(duration), \n                                    duration := mean_dur][1:5,]\n\nWarning in `[.data.table`(batrips_new[, `:=`(mean_dur, mean(duration, na.rm =\nTRUE)), : 1013.944704 (type 'double') at RHS position 1 out-of-range(NA) or\ntruncated (precision lost) when assigning to type 'integer' (column 2 named\n'duration')\n\n\n   trip_id duration          start_date           start_station start_terminal\n     &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;              &lt;POSc&gt;                  &lt;char&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1:  139545      435 2014-01-01 00:14:00 San Francisco City Hall             58\n2:  139546      432 2014-01-01 00:14:00 San Francisco City Hall             58\n3:  139547     1523 2014-01-01 00:17:00  Embarcadero at Sansome             60\n4:  139549     1620 2014-01-01 00:23:00       Steuart at Market             74\n5:  139550     1617 2014-01-01 00:23:00       Steuart at Market             74\n              end_date        end_station end_terminal bike_id\n                &lt;POSc&gt;             &lt;char&gt;        &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1: 2014-01-01 00:21:00    Townsend at 7th           65     473\n2: 2014-01-01 00:21:00    Townsend at 7th           65     395\n3: 2014-01-01 00:42:00    Beale at Market           56     331\n4: 2014-01-01 00:50:00 Powell Street BART           39     605\n5: 2014-01-01 00:50:00 Powell Street BART           39     453\n   subscription_type zip_code trips_N duration_mean mean_dur\n              &lt;char&gt;   &lt;char&gt;   &lt;int&gt;         &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1:        Subscriber    94612    2145      678.6364 1013.945\n2:        Subscriber    94107    2145      678.6364 1013.945\n3:        Subscriber    94112   12879      651.2367 1013.945\n4:          Customer    92007   11579      883.9379 1013.945\n5:          Customer    92007   11579      883.9379 1013.945\n\n# Delete the mean_dur column by reference\nbatrips_new[, mean_dur := mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE), \n            by = month(start_date)][is.na(duration), \n                                    duration := mean_dur][, mean_dur := NULL]"

For example, using open circles instead of filled ones:\n# Use open circle symbols\nwinequality %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(x = ~residual_sugar, y = ~fixed_acidity) %&gt;%\n  add_markers(marker = list(symbol = \"circle-open\"))\n\n\nOther Marker Options\nYou can also customize other marker properties:\n\nSize: Adjust the size of scatterplot points.\nWidth: Modify the width of lines dividing bars in histograms or bar charts."

This double-encoding strategy uses two pre-attentive visual cues to more-quickly communicate information to the reader. This idea is implemented by default in plotly; if you map a variable to the symbol, plotly automatically maps the variable to the color.\nTo map a variable to the plotting shape, add a symbol argument to the plot_ly() command.\nCaution: It is poor practice to use color and shape to communicate different variables, since the two features have been shown to interfere with each other, making it more difficult to distinguish either variable.\n\n\n\nUse the vgsales2016 data frame to create a scatterplot with Critic_Score on the x-axis and User_Score on the y-axis where the plotting symbol represents a game’s Rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a scatterplot of User_Score against Critic_Score coded by Rating\nvgsales2016 %&gt;%\n   plot_ly(x = ~Critic_Score, y = ~ User_Score) %&gt;%\n

This is a great way to explore distributions and relationships across factors. In this exercise, you will explore how the relationship between critic score and user score changes (or stays the same) across platform.\nNote that plotly and dplyr have already been loaded for you.\n\n\n\nCreate a scatterplot showing Critic_Score on the x-axis and User_Score on the y-axis for PS4 games. Name the trace for the platform and store this plot as p1.\nCreate a scatterplot showing Critic_Score on the x-axis and User_Score on the y-axis for XOne video games.

This was not very tedious because you were only focused on two groups. However, there are 6 platforms in the vgsales2016 dataset, and it would be very tedious to manually code 6 scatterplots.\nIn this exercise, you will practice using group_by(), nest(), mutate(), and map2() to automate the process of creating a faceted scatterplot using the following template:\n    data %&gt;%\n      group_by(factor) %&gt;%\n      nest() %&gt;%\n      mutate(\n          plot = map2(data, factor,\n            \\(data, factor) \n                plot_ly(data = data, x = ~x, y = ~y) %&gt;%\n                      add_markers(name = ~factor)\n        )) %&gt;%\n      subplot(nrows = R, shareY = TRUE, shareX = TRUE)\n\n\n\nUse group_by(), nest(), and mutate(), and map2() to create a faceted scatterplot showing Critic_Score on the x-axis and User_Score on the y-axis, where the facets are defined by Platform.\nArrange the facets in a grid with 3 rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a faceted scatterplot of User_Score vs. Critic_Score with 3 rows\nvgsales2016 %&gt;%\n  group_by(Platform) %&gt;%\n  nest() %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    plot = map2(\n      data, Platform,\n      \\(data, Platform) \n        plot_ly(data = data, x = ~Critic_Score, y = ~User_Score) %&gt;%\n        add_markers(name = ~Platform)\n    )) %&gt;%\n  subplot(nrows = 3, shareY = TRUE, shareX = TRUE)\n\nWarning: Ignoring 66 observations\n\n\nWarning: Ignoring 36 observations\n\n\nWarning: Ignoring 27 observations\n\n\nWarning: Ignoring 5 observations\n\n\nWarning: Ignoring 38 observations\n\n\nWarning: Ignoring 9 observations\n\n\nWarning: Ignoring 13 observations\n\n\nWarning: Ignoring 75 observations\n\n\nWarning: Ignoring 1 observations\n\n\nWarning: Can't display both discrete & non-discrete data on same axis\nWarning: Can't display both discrete & non-discrete data on same axis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot and axis titles\nIn the previous two exercises, you saw a set of subplots that lack any axis labels and a set of subplots that used the column names as axis labels. Why are they different? By default, the subplot() command sets titleX = shareX and titleY = shareY; thus, axis labels are only displayed if shareX and/or shareY are TRUE. You can add titleX = TRUE and/or titleY = TRUE to override this behavior.\nIn this example, your task is to add titles to subplots. Note that plotly has already been loaded for you.\nNote: When you run your solution, you will see two warning messages about ignoring observations. These messages simply indicate that plotly is ignoring missing values.\n\n\n\nAdapt the subplot() code to allow the x- and y-axis titles to be shared.\nAdd the title \"User score vs. critic score by platform, 2016\" to the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add x-axis and y-axis labels, and a title\nsubplot(p1, p2, nrows = 2, shareX = T, shareY = T) %&gt;%\n   layout(title = \"User score vs. critic score by platform, 2016\")\n\n\n\n\n\nPolishing axis titles\nThe axes in a subplot can be renamed using the layout() command, just like in a single plot; however, there are multiple x-axes to rename. For example, a 2 x 2 grid of plots requires four x-axis labels:\np %&gt;% # subplot\n   layout(\n     xaxis = list(title = \"title 1\"), \n     xaxis2 = list(title = \"title 2\"),\n     xaxis3 = list(title = \"title 3\"), \n     xaxis4 = list(title = \"title 4\")\n   )\nA similar strategy holds for the y-axis labels.\nIn this example, your task is to polish the axis titles on a subplot. Note that plotly has already been loaded for you.\n\n\n\nFor the first plot in sp2, use \"Global Sales (M units)\" for the y-axis label, and leave the x-axis label blank.\nFor the second plot in sp2, label the x-axis \"Year\" and the y-axis \"Global Sales (M units)\".\n\n\n\n\n\np1  &lt;- vgsales %&gt;%\n  filter(Publisher %in% c(\"Nintendo\", \"Electronic Arts\", \"Activision\",\n                       \"Sony Computer Entertainment\", \"Ubisoft\")) %&gt;%\n  count(Publisher) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;%\n  head(5) %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Publisher, y = ~n, color = ~Publisher) %&gt;%\n  add_bars()\n\np2 &lt;- vgsales %&gt;%\n  filter(Publisher %in% c(\"Nintendo\", \"Electronic Arts\", \"Activision\",\n                       \"Sony Computer Entertainment\", \"Ubisoft\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Publisher, Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_sales = n()) %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Year, y =  ~total_sales, color = ~Publisher) %&gt;%\n  add_lines()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Publisher'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\nsp2 &lt;- subplot(p1, p2, nrows = 1)\n\n# Add x-axis and y-axis labels, and a title to  sp2\nsp2 %&gt;%\n   layout(\n     xaxis = list(title = ''), \n     xaxis2 = list(title = \"Year\"),\n     yaxis = list(title = 'Global Sales (M units)'), \n     yaxis2 = list(title = \"Global Sales (M units)\")\n   )"
